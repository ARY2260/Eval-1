Photosynthesis is the process by which plants use sunlight water and carbon dioxide to create oxygen and energy in the form of sugar,1,1
Photosynthesis is a process by which phototrophs convert light energy into chemical energy which is later used to fuel cellular activities. The chemical energy is stored in the form of sugars which are created from water and carbon dioxide,1,1
Photosynthesis is the process used by plants algae and some bacteria to turn sunlight into energy. The process chemically converts carbon dioxide (CO2) and water into food (sugars) and oxygen. The chemical reaction often relies on a pigment called chlorophyll which gives plants their green color,1,1
Plants use sunlight water and the gases in the air to make glucose which is a form of sugar that plants need to survive. This process is called photosynthesis and is performed by all plants algae and even some microorganisms. To perform photosynthesis plants need three things: carbon dioxide water and sunlight,1,1
Photosynthesis is a process used by plants and other organisms to convert light energy into chemical energy that through cellular respiration can later be released to fuel the organism's activities,1,1
Photosynthesis the process by which green plants and certain other organisms transform light energy into chemical energy. During photosynthesis in green plants light energy is captured and used to convert water carbon dioxide and minerals into oxygen and energy-rich organic compounds,1,1
Photosynthesis is the process in which light energy is converted to chemical energy in the form of sugars. In a process driven by light energy glucose molecules (or other sugars) are constructed from water and carbon dioxide and oxygen is released as a byproduct,1,1
Green plants make sugar for growth by a process called photosynthesis which means making things with light. Plants use sunlight water and carbon dioxide to create oxygen and energy in the form of sugar,1,1
Photosynthesis is a chemical process by which plants some bacteria and algae convert energy derived from sunlight to chemical energy. This is an important process for biological life on earth because it allows energy from sunlight to be harnessed and transferred into a form that can be utilized by organisms to fuel their activity,1,1
