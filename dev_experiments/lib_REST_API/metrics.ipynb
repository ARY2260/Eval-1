The following way valley sinks are evolved: In dolomite, limestone, or karst zones, the rocks are permeable and are made up of highly fused and broken rocks. In karst areas, small to medium-sized shallow pits are formed due to seepage of surface water, and these shallow pits are called sinkholes. Surface water from these sinkholes drains into the underground. The bottom of these sinkholes forms underground caves and sinkholes sometimes collapse and are commonly called collapse sinks or dolines. Typically, surface runoff runs down through sinkholes and flows underground, and at some distance through cave openings again to the surface. valley sinks or uvulas are developed when sinkholes and doline join together due to the collapse of cave ceilings.</td>\n",
