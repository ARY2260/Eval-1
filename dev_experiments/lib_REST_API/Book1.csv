1,Explain the evolution of valley sinks or uvalas.,"Quite often the surface run-off simply goes down swallow and sink holes and flow as underground streams and reemerge at a distance downstream through a cave opening. When sink holes and dolines join together because of slumping of materials along their margins or due to roof collapse of caves, long, narrow to wide trenches called valley sinks or uvalas form.","Generally, the surface run-off simply goes down swallow and sink holes and flow as underground streams and re-emerge at a distance downstream through a cave opening. When sink holes and dolines join together because of slumping of materials along their margins or due to roof collapse of caves, long, narrow to wide trenches called valley sinks or Uvalas form.","A sink hole is on opening more or less circular at the top and funnel-shaped towards the bottom with sizes varying in area from a few sq.m to a hectare and with depth from a less than half a metre to thirty metres or more. Quite often the surface run-off simply goes down swallow and sink holes and flow as underground streams and re-emerge at a distance downstream through a cave opening. A doline is a collapsed sink. When sinkholes and dolines join together because of slumping of materials along their margins or due to roof collapse of caves, long narrow to wide trenches called valley sinks or uvalas form.","Normally, the run-off goes down swallow and sink holes and drifts as underground streams and re-emerges at a distance downstream through a cave starting. When sink holes and dolines are merged due to slumping of substances alongside their margins or because of roof collapse of caves, trenches known as valley sinks or Uvalas are formed.","Valley sinks or uvulas are the same things. Valley sinks are erosional landforms of Karst topography. The following way valley sinks are evolved: In dolomite, limestone, or karst zones, the rocks are permeable and are made up of highly fused and broken rocks. In karst areas, small to medium-sized shallow pits are formed due to seepage of surface water, and these shallow pits are called sinkholes. Surface water from these sinkholes drains into the underground. The bottom of these sinkholes forms underground caves and sinkholes sometimes collapse and are commonly called collapse sinks or dolines. Typically, surface runoff runs down through sinkholes and flows underground, and at some distance through cave openings again to the surface. valley sinks or uvulas are developed when sinkholes and doline join together due to the collapse of cave ceilings."
2,"While the pressure gradient force is from north to south, i.e. from the subtropical high pressure to the equator in the northern hemisphere, why are the winds north easterlies in the tropics?","Winds always move from High Pressure to Low Pressure zone, that�s why pressure gradient force is from north to south. And the north easterlies winds move towards south western region.","Rotation of the earth also affects the wind movement. The force exerted by the rotation of the earth is known as the Coriolis force. Due to this effect, winds move to the right from their original direction in northern hemisphere and to the left in the southern hemisphere. The deflection is more when the wind velocity is high. The Coriolis force is directly proportional to the angle of latitude. It is maximum at the poles and is absent at the equator. The Coriolis force acts perpendicular to the pressure gradient force. The pressure gradient force is perpendicular to an isobar. The higher the pressure gradient force, the more is the velocity of the wind and the larger is the deflection in the direction of wind. As a result of these two forces operating perpendicular to each other, in the low-pressure areas the wind blows around it. Therefore, when pressure gradient force is from south to north then winds move from south to north easterlies.","The winds blow from high pressure to the low pressure, so this pressure gradient force is from north to south. Therefore the north easterlies blow from north- east to south-west.",,
3,Explain the land and sea breezes.,"During the day the land heats up faster and becomes warmer than the sea. Therefore, over the land the air rises giving rise to a low pressure area, whereas the sea is relatively cool and the pressure over sea is relatively high. Thus, pressure gradient from sea to land is created and the wind blows from the sea to the land which is known as sea breeze. In the night the reversal of condition takes place. The land loses heat faster and is cooler than the sea. The pressure gradient is from the land to the sea. This breeze is known as land breeze.","The Land Breeze and the Sea Breeze is a common phenomenon observed in the coastal areas. As per definition, Land Breeze is the breeze that blows from land to sea, whereas the Sea Breeze blows from water/sea onto land. 1. Sea Breeze: During the day, land gets heated up faster than water, while water takes time to acquire the same temperature as there in the land. Hence, the air above the land gets warmed up and rises, while making a region of low pressure above land. Comparatively, the air above the sea is cooler and has a higher pressure. Thus, once the air above the land rises up by convection, it creates a space for the cool breeze from the sea to flow in. This is called Sea Breeze. 2. Land Breeze: The heating capacity of water is higher than that of sand. Hence, the sea water will retain heat much better as compared to the sand present at the land. During the night, the land cools down faster as compared to water while creating a high-pressure region over land and resulting in a low-pressure zone above sea water. The air above the water is comparatively warmer and rises up, thus creating space for cool wind over land to move in towards the sea. This is called Land Breeze.","Land breeze: blowing breeze from land towards the sea is called a land breeze. They are formed during the night when sea water and land both lose heat, specific heat capacity of land being very low as compared to that of sea water, land loses heat energy fast and cools more rapidly as compared to the sea. Sea water being at higher temperature, the air becomes lighter and rises up. Air from land being at higher pressure. So air from land starts blowing towards the sea and gives rise to a land breeze. Sea breeze: blowing breeze from sea towards land during the day is called sea breeze. They are formed during the day time when land and sea both are heated equally by the sun, but land has very low specific heat capacity as compared to the sea, so it is heated up more quickly, thus air above land due to heat becomes lighter and rises up. Thus pressure decreases and cold and humid air above the sea blowing towards land.","Land breeze is also known as off- shore wind and takes place during the night and early morning and in winter or autumn season. Land breezes result in the formation and development of clouds. In simple words a land breeze is the flow of wind from the land towards the sea. During the night time, the land cools down quickly as compared to the day because there is no sun to heat surrounding air and the sea surface. As  compared to land, water bodies have a capacity to retain the heat for a longer duration, which causes the air above it to have lower density and  due to this high pressure is formed above the land and at the same time low pressure is formed above the water.The movement of the dense air above the land takes place from land to space over water as the movement of the winds takes place from high pressure to low-pressure areas. Sea Breeze also known as on - shore wind takes place during the day time  and in spring and summer season.  Sea Breeze occurs due to unequal heating of land and water as during a day the land surface heats up faster than the sea surface which results in the relatively heather air above the land than the water. As we all know that warmer air is lighter than the cooler air and as a result the warmer air goes up, which means here the warmer air is above the land and this will rise up and the coller air is flowing towards the land surface and taking the space of the warmer air. ","LAND BREEZE : Blowing of breeze (air) from land towards sea is called land breeze. During night land and sea water both lose heat. Specific heat capacity of land being very low as compared to that of sea water, land loses heat energy fast and cools more rapidly as compared to sea. Sea water being at higher temperature, the air above it becomes lighter and rise up. Air from land being at higher pressure. So air from land starts blowing towards sea and gives rise to Land Breeze. SEA BREEZE: Blowing of breeze (cold air) from the sea towards land during the day is called the SEA BREEZE. During day time land and sea both are heated equally by the sun, but land has very low specific heat capacity as compared to sea, is heated up more quickly. Thus air above land due to heat becomes lighter and rises up. Thus pressure decreases and cold and humid air above the sea starts blowing towards land, thereby giving rise to SEABREEZE."
4,What is biodiversity?,"Biodiversity itself is a combination of two words, Bio (life) and diversity (variety). In simple wTords, biodiversity is the number and variety of organisms found within a specified geographic region. It refers to the varieties of plants, animals and micro-organisms, the genes they contain and the ecosystems they form. It relates to the variability among living organisms on the earth, including the variability within and between the species and that within and between the ecosystems.","Biodiversity is all the different kinds of life you�ll find in one area�the variety of animals, plants, fungi, and even microorganisms like bacteria that make up our natural world. Each of these species and organisms work together in ecosystems, like an intricate web, to maintain balance and support life. Biodiversity supports everything in nature that we need to survive: food, clean water, medicine, and shelter.","Biodiversity describes the richness and variety of life on earth. It is the most complex and important feature of our planet. Without biodiversity, life would not sustain. The term biodiversity was coined in 1985. It is important in natural as well as artificial ecosystems. It deals with nature�s variety, the biosphere. It refers to variabilities among plants, animals and microorganism species. Biodiversity includes the number of different organisms and their relative frequencies in an ecosystem. It also reflects the organization of organisms at different levels. Biodiversity holds ecological and economic significance. It provides us with nourishment, housing, fuel, clothing and several other resources. It also extracts monetary benefits through tourism. Therefore, it is very important to have a good knowledge of biodiversity for a sustainable livelihood.","The�sum total of species richness, i.e., the number of species of plants, animals�and micro-organisms inhabiting in a given habitat is known as biodiversity.","Biodiversity is the name we give to the variety of all life on Earth. Bacteria to baboons, plants to people - the range of life on our planet is incredible. All living things exist within their own communities, or ecosystems - oceans, forests, deserts, ice caps and even cities. All this put together is biodiversity: the volume of life on Earth as well as how different species interact with each other and with the physical world around them."
5,Discuss briefly the importance of animals to human kind.,The importance of animals to humankind are discussed below: i. They produce and decompose organic materials. ii. They help to cycle water and nutrients throughout the ecosystem. iii. Fix atmospheric gases and help to regulate the climate.,"The earth, its ecosystems, and its creatures are all deeply connected. Thus, the existence of many species depends on the survival of others, and don�t think human beings are an exception. As disconnected from nature as many of us humans have become, there are many animals we rely on for our benefit and wellbeing. Many animals actually help people just by performing their natural roles in their environment. And we�re benefiting from their services for free.","Plants and animals have played an important role in human life for as long as they've all existed. In fact, without the plants and animals that humans have used for food, labor, tools and companionship over countless generations, society could not have advanced to the point it has today. Humans have used plants and animals as food, labor, tools and companions. People would not have survived without the help of several species of plants and animals.","Animals are found to be very important for human survival as they are used for various purposes, like food, rearing, clothing, medicine, etc. The field of science that deals with the improvement of domestication of animals are known as animal husbandry. A list of useful animals for humans are: We use cattle like cows for milk and meat, which are a high source of vitamins and minerals. We use chicken and hen for eggs and meat which are major sources of proteins. Camels, horses ad elephants are used for transportation. Some important domesticated animals are dogs, cats, sheep, goats, etc. Fishes are reared and used for food, fish oil, manure, glue, and some important medicinal purposes. Horses, donkeys, and elephants are used for carrying heavy loads. Animal litter is also used as a source of manure which helps to supplement required nutrients in the soil. Sheep are reared for their soft and warm wool. They also provide milk and other medicinal purposes. Animals help to control the population of other animals hence, helping to maintain an ecological balance. Many aquatic creatures are very helpful to humans as well as to other than the territorial animal.","Human uses of animals (non-human species) include both practical uses, such as the production of food and clothing, and symbolic uses, such as in art, literature, mythology, and religion. All of these are elements of culture, broadly understood. Animals used in these ways include fish, crustaceans, insects, molluscs, mammals and birds. Economically, animals provide meat, whether farmed or hunted, and until the arrival of mechanised transport, terrestrial mammals provided a large part of the power used for work and transport. Animals serve as models in biological research, such as in genetics, and in drug testing. Many species are kept as pets, the most popular being mammals, especially dogs and cats. These are often anthropomorphised."
6,How did the discovery of South America lead to the development of European colonialism?,"European countries were greedy for gold and silver. It was their expectation that a heavy quantity of gold was available in South America. So, they settled in different regions. International trade and industrialisation expanded in the region. They established their rule with the help of military strength. But local people resisted it. But the Spaniards suppressed their resistance. The merchants brought a variety of products to the Europeans such as tobacco, potatoes, sugarcane, cacao and rubber. Europe also became familiar with new crops from America, notably potatoes and chillies. The merchants formed joint stock companies and sent out trading expeditions. Profit was the main objective. The newly discovered land earned huge wealth. It also gave an impetus to the revolution. Thus it can be said that the discovery of South America led to the development to European colonialism.","The �discovery� of South America leads to the development of European Colonialism because European countries, especially Spain and Portugal, were greedy of gold and silver. They expected that a heavy quantity of gold was available in South America. That�s why they settled over there in different regions. Between the time 1560 and 1600, hundreds of shipped sailed each other carrying silver from the mines of South America to Spain. The Europeans also became recognizable with new crops like potatoes and chillies. They established their rule over there with the help of military strength and gunpowder, local people resisted their rule with violence and many incidents happen consequently. But this resistance was ruthlessly suppressed by the Spaniards. They forced the local people to pay tribute. They used local chiefs for discovering new regions and new traces of gold. When other Europeans came to know about this vast reserves of gold and silver in South America then they also travelled and starting settling there. They too made the local as their slaves and forced them to work in mines and to menial jobs. Their life was enslaved and their way of life was destructed. In this way, South America was completely caught in the clutches of European Imperialism.","1. For Europe, the discovery of the Americas had consequences for others besides the initial voyages. The influx of gold and silver helped further expansion of international trade and industrialisation. Between 1560 and 1600, a hundred ships each year carried silver from South American mines to Spain.  But it was not Spain and Portugal that benefited. They did not invest their huge income in further trade, or in building up a merchant navy. Instead, it was the countries bordering the Atlantic, particularly England, France, Belgium and Holland, that took advantage of the discoveries. 2. Their merchants formed joint-stock companies and sent out trading expeditions, established colonies and introduced Europeans to the products of the New World, including tobacco, potatoes, cane sugar, cacao and rubber. 3. Europe also became familiar with new crops from America, notably potatoes and chillies. These were then taken by Europeans to other countries like India. 4. For the native people of the Americans, the immediate consequences were the physical decimation of local populations, the destruction of their way of life and their enslavement in mines, plantations and mills.","The discovery of America by Christopher Columbus opened the gates of the land to more European colonial powers. The 'New World' soon emerged as the most coveted zone for the Spanish and the Portuguese. The Spanish were very aggressive in their approach and, within a short span of fifty years, were able to control a major part of the Western Hemisphere. To fulfil their greed for gold and the desire to convert the natives to Christians, the Spanish left no stone unturned. They used both military strength and the fear of gunpowder to shun all efforts of the natives to revolt against the European power. The Spanish friar Bartolome de las Casas, the most severe critic of the Spanish conquerors, observed that the Spanish often tested their swords on the naked flesh of the Arawaks. The colonisation of America helped the Spaniards in various ways. They were able to attain gold and introduced to new nutritious American foods. The constant flow of goods and money from the colony helped to make the Spanish land more prosperous. This success established Spain as a dominant colonial power in the world stage. The Portuguese were the next to follow. They were only interested in the trade of timber from Brazil. To protect the trade link, many Portuguese traders started settling in the Brazilian coast. These Europeans, over time, started the production of sugar-cane. These activities facilitated the expansion of the Portuguese-controlled areas and shrinkage of the native lands. The success of the Portuguese in America soon attracted other Europeans to the land. Thus, it can be stated that the discovery of the land rich in resources attracted Europeans and led to the development for colonialism.","European maritime projects produced knowledge of continuous sea passage from ocean to ocean. England, France, Belgium and Holland invested in developing merchant navies. The merchants from these countries formed joint-stock companies and sent out trading expeditions. In due course of time, they established colonies in many countries of Asia, Africa and Americas."
7,Indicate how the supply of raw materials affected the nature of British industrialization.,"Since 17th century, Britain had been importing bales of cotton cloth from India at exorbitant price. But after the entry of East India Company into India, it began to import along with cloth, raw cotton, which could be spun and woven into cloth in England. Till the early 18th century, the process of spinning had been very slow. The spinners were occupied throughout the day, while weavers waited idly to receive yarn. A lot of technological inventions closed the gap between the speed in spinning raw cotton into yarn, and weaving the yarn into fabric. The production shifted from the homes of spinners and weavers to factories.","(i) The British got raw materials for the textile industries in India in form of cotton bales and began to export it for weaving clothes. It shifted the processing from homes to factories. (ii) Initially, spinning consumes a lot of time, but with the invention of technical knowledge, the production began to increases. It increased the demand for raw material. (iii) The political motives of imperialism. It further extended in the form of imperialism. It also led to the economic exploitation. (iv) It boosted the Britishers industrial methods to gain more and more raw material forms colonial countries.","The Industrial Revolution required a work drive which advertised itself for compensation besides the raw materials and the markets. The work drive which was required presently was to be a portable one conjointly gifted. The development of populace in Europe enormously encouraged the work supply. Connecting to transport and modern manufacturing plants, none of it would have been conceivable without Britain's huge supply of crude materials. A few crude materials went to create press and steel which was at that point made into apparatus, railroads and much more. There was moreover a huge supply of coal to control steam motors and bounty of press to construct apparatus.","i. Cotton in the form of large rolls were brought to Britain in the form of raw material from their colonies and India being one of them on the other hand this cotton was exported by Britain which was used for weaving clothes and thus they gain profits. ii. Britain�s industrial method were imposed to gain more raw materials. iii. There was economic exploitation. iv. With technical invention a less time was required in spinning and this ultimately led to increase in production. Which was then linked to the theory of Demand and Supply, since there was increase demand for finished products so the demand for raw material increased.",
8,Industrialisation was a natural step in the progress of mankind. Why?,"During the prehistoric period, human beings were wanderers. They searched their food for their livelihood. They made tools of stone for hunting animals and satisfying their hunger. But as the time advanced, their needs increased. They made new inventions. Trade and commerce started. For trading, transportation was necessary. Communication was established. New industries were set up. People became financially sound. On this basis, it can be said that industrialization was a natural step in the progress of mankind.","We can say without any doubt and hesitation that industrialization was a natural step in man's progress. Because progress is natural to mankind. Moreover, it has rightly been said and proved that 'Necessity is the mother of invention'. It can very easily be proved if we have a glance on the life of man since the beginning of mankind i.e., the prehistoric days. In the Pre-historic period the stone-age man made rough tools and weapons of stone to hunt the wild animals for food etc. Gradually the man improved these stone implements. In due course he learnt how to make fire and invented wheel. The invention of wheel was helpful in farming, pottery and above all transportation. By and by the human society divided itself into various occupations and professions. Some became farmers, some other black-smiths, weavers, carpenters, potters, soldiers etc. Then there arose the need for trade. For trade the means of transport were so developed that trade and commerce became the major occupations of people. With the rapid growth in trade, increase in population, need and demand for the various commodities, the desire for more profit inspired the people for more production. For more and rapid production of the goods the inventions were made. The machines of various kinds were invented and the factories were setup. The exchange of goods through trade among the different countries rapidly progressed when it still developing and continuing. So in this way the Industrialization took place which was a natural, step in man's progress.","Yes, Industrialization was a natural step in Man progress; following are the reasons in support of this statement: 1. The growth of industrialization changed the existing nature of trade, by making cities the centers of economic activities. Prior to industrialization, people was more dependent on agriculture but after the arrival of industrialization a large section of society engaged in industries. This gave employment to people and through which people could have access to other things that earlier they did not have. 2. The Industrial Revolution brought nations and communities together. It is because of Industrialization that communities began sharing universal consciousness, which led to the advancement or progress of one place to influence the progress of other places. 3. It is the Industrialization that led to scientific advancement and men's progress.","We can say without any doubt and hesitation that industrialization was a natural step in man's progress.

The exchange of goods through trade among the different countries rapidly progressed when it still developing and continuing. So in this way the Industrialization took place which was a natural, step in man's progress.",
9,The invention of steam engine revolutionized industry and transport. How?,"The steam engine was invented by James Watt in 1769. Its invention brought about a drastic change in the life of mankind. It revolutionized the entire industrial set up. Steam engine technology was further developed with the use of lighter and stronger metals. It increased the manufacturing of more accurate machine tools. In 1840, British steam engines were generating more than 70% of the European power. Its invention connected the people even from the distant areas. It also linked people on commercial point. Trade relations between different regions got more strengthened. It also helped in transportation of luggage from one place to another. Now the peasants could sold their products in the markets and also earn huge profit.","The introduction of steam engines improved productivity and technology, and allowed the creation of smaller and better engines. After Richard Trevithick's development of the high-pressure engine, transport applications became possible, and steam engines found their way to boats, railways, farms and road vehicles. Steam engines are an example of how changes brought by industrialization led to even more changes in other areas.",The steam locomotive changed transportation by allowing us to ship goods and travel faster than ever before. It gave us the ability to create new industries and mold transport into what it has become today. The steam locomotive was an icon of the industrial revolution in many countries throughout the world.,"1. Water as hydraulic power had been the prime source of energy for centuries, but it had been limited to certain areas, seasons and by the speed of flow of the water. Now it was used differently. Steam power provided pressure at high temperatures that enabled the use of a broad range of machinery. This meant that steam power was the only source of energy that was reliable and inexpensive enough to manufacture machinery itself. 2. Steam power was first used in mining industries. As the demand for coal and metals expanded, efforts to obtain them from ever-deeper mines intensified. Flooding in mines was a serious problem. Thomas Savery (1650-1715) built a model steam-engine called the Miner's Friend in 1698 to drain mines. These engines worked slowly, in shallow depths, and the boiler burst under too much pressure. 3. Another steam-engine was built by Thomas Newcomen (1663-1729) in 1712. This had the major defect of losing energy due to continuous cooling of the condensing cylinder. 4. The steam-engine had been used only in coal mines until James Watt (1736-1819) developed his machine in 1796. Watt's invention converted the steam engine from being a mere pump into a prime mover capable of providing energy to power machines in factories. Backed by the wealthy manufacturer Matthew Boulton (1728-1809), Watt created the Soho Foundry in Birmingham in 1775. From this foundry Watt's steam engines were produced in steadily growing numbers. By the end of the eighteenth century, Watt's steam engine was beginning to replace hydraulic power. 5. After 1800, steam engine technology was further developed with the use of ligter, stronger metals, the manufacture of more accurate machine tools and the spread of better scientific knowledge. In 1840, British steam engines were generating more than 70 per cent of all European horsepower.","England's primary fuel source in the late 1600s was wood, but as the steam engine entered mass production, coal became a popular fuel. The development of the steam engine acted as a catalyst in the Industrial Revolution, placing England on top of the world in production and exportation of coal. This new piece of technology would allow England to improve her communication with the established and growing colonies. Beginning in the early 1700s, three British scientists invented and enhanced the steam engine as technology improved to allow the British Empire to increase and revolutionize coal mining. This ultimately transformed the British economy and way of life, both were vastly dependent on agriculture. The steam engine would also eventually help England spread her sphere of influence and colonize other parts of the world. The steam engines would be used to kick-start the rest of the Industrial Revolution."
10,What are neural networks?,"Neural networks, also known as artificial neural networks (ANNs) or simulated neural networks (SNNs), are a subset of machine learning and are at the heart of deep learning algorithms. Their name and structure are inspired by the human brain, mimicking the way that biological neurons signal to one another. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are comprised of a node layers, containing an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. Each node, or artificial neuron, connects to another and has an associated weight and threshold. If the output of any individual node is above the specified threshold value, that node is activated, sending data to the next layer of the network. Otherwise, no data is passed along to the next layer of the network. Neural networks rely on training data to learn and improve their accuracy over time. However, once these learning algorithms are fine-tuned for accuracy, they are powerful tools in computer science and artificial intelligence, allowing us to classify and cluster data at a high velocity. Tasks in speech recognition or image recognition can take minutes versus hours when compared to the manual identification by human experts. One of the most well-known neural networks is Google�s search algorithm.","A neural network is a series of algorithms that endeavors to recognize underlying relationships in a set of data through a process that mimics the way the human brain operates. In this sense, neural networks refer to systems of neurons, either organic or artificial in nature. Neural networks can adapt to changing input; so the network generates the best possible result without needing to redesign the output criteria. The concept of neural networks, which has its roots in artificial intelligence, is swiftly gaining popularity in the development of trading systems. Neural networks are a series of algorithms that mimic the operations of an animal brain to recognize relationships between vast amounts of data. As such, they tend to resemble the connections of neurons and synapses found in the brain. They are used in a variety of applications in financial services, from forecasting and marketing research to fraud detection and risk assessment. Neural networks with several process layers are known as ""deep"" networks and are used for deep learning algorithms.","A neural network is a method in artificial intelligence that teaches computers to process data in a way that is inspired by the human brain. It is a type of machine learning process, called deep learning, that uses interconnected nodes or neurons in a layered structure that resembles the human brain. It creates an adaptive system that computers use to learn from their mistakes and improve continuously. Thus, artificial neural networks attempt to solve complicated problems, like summarizing documents or recognizing faces, with greater accuracy.","In information technology (IT), an artificial neural network (ANN) is a system of hardware and/or software patterned after the operation of neurons in the human brain. ANNs -- also called, simply, neural networks -- are a variety of deep learning technology, which also falls under the umbrella of artificial intelligence, or AI. Commercial applications of these technologies generally focus on solving complex signal processing or pattern recognition problems. Examples of significant commercial applications since 2000 include handwriting recognition for check processing, speech-to-text transcription, oil-exploration data analysis, weather prediction and facial recognition. The history of artificial neural networks goes back to the early days of computing. In 1943, mathematicians Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts built a circuitry system intended to approximate the functioning of the human brain that ran simple algorithms. It wasn't until around 2010 that research picked up again. The big data trend, where companies amass vast troves of data, and parallel computing gave data scientists the training data and computing resources needed to run complex artificial neural networks. In 2012, a neural network was able to beat human performance at an image recognition task as part of the ImageNet competition. Since then, interest in artificial neural networks as has soared and the technology continues to improve.","An artificial neural network learning algorithm, or neural network, or just neural net, is a computational learning system that uses a network of functions to understand and translate a data input of one form into a desired output, usually in another form. The concept of the artificial neural network was inspired by human biology and the way neurons of the human brain function together to understand inputs from human senses. Neural networks are just one of many tools and approaches used in machine learning algorithms. The neural network itself may be used as a piece in many different machine learning algorithms to process complex data inputs into a space that computers can understand. Neural networks are being applied to many real-life problems today, including speech and image recognition, spam email filtering, finance, and medical diagnosis, to name a few. "
